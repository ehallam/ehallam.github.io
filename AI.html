    <h1 class="text-center">AI's Positive Contributions To Society</h1>
    <h2 class="text-center">Forward</h2>
    <p>AI, although potrayed through fiction and through the warnings of influential people 
        such as Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk and Bill Gates, as a potentially existential threat,
        it at least, in the short term has many positives which it can bring to society.</p>

        <h2>Health Care</h2>
        <p> Perhaps one of the most positive contributions AI has brought this century has been in the field of health care. Diagnosis' have never been better than they are currently.
          Through a combination of vasts amounts of data and machine learning techniques, AI has been found to be more accurate 
          at diagnosing diseases than 72% of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17419-7#Sec3">doctors.</a>        


        </p>
        
        <h2>Recomendation Systems</h2>
        <p>AI has helped develop recomendation systems which are eerily attuned to our preferences and tastes. Some of the most sophisticated and well used recommender algorithms include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Youtubes Video Recomendation</li> <!--Youtube's not Youtubes-->
          <li> Spotify's Music Recomendation</li>
          <li> Amazon's Product Recomendation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You could potentially argue that this is a negative contribution to society as people will watch, listen and buy more from Youtube, Spotify and Amazon.
          On the other hand, you could argue that the recommendation algorithms will allow users to find more satisfaction in their lives; more entertained by the videos they watched, 
          more invigorated by music they listen to and more satisfied in what they have bought.
