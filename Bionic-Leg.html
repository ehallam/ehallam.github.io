    <p>
        This bionic prosthetic open source project is allowing researchers
        to develop and test prosthetics
    </p>
    <p>The range of products available are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Knees</li>
        <li>Ankles</li>
        <li>Legs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Equipped with electric motors, these are being developed to help patients walk again</p>
    <p>The previous issue has been with the weight of the person on the prosthetics.
        Elliott Rouse and his team tackled this problem using the Open Source Leg
        As an open source project, this was free for other scientists and researchers
        to use
    </p>
    <p>
        Rouse and his team provided step by step instructions to help researchers set up
        and get the parts required to build and program these prosthetics
    </p>
