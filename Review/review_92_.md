# i. Interest of Content
  **Sound:** Good selection of interesting projects, but the presentation lets them down 

# ii. Consistency and quality of visual presentation
 **Outstanding:** All the pages feel the same, but one of them has the navigation bar in the wrong place.

# iii. Quality of written presentation
  **Sound:** Little to no CSS to make the page more interesting, for example tje text could look better if it was centered.

# iv. Validity of HTML
  **Good:** The HTML looks very good, but one key thing to improve is making sure the CSS is in its own seperate file instead of being embedded into the HTML file.

# v. Evidence of Collaboration
  **Very Good** No Author Information Included. Commits are consistent throughout the week (27th, 31st, 1st, 3rd). Ehallam has commited far more times than others in the project, but everyone has contributed
